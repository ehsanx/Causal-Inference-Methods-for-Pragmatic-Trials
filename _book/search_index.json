Pragmatic trials include a broader range of subjects, who receive the treatment in everyday clinical practice in a real-world usual care scenario; and are much more representative than those selected for a regular clinical trial. In the pragmatic trials, as in the usual care scenario, patients can deviate from the protocol, e.g., they may not be adherent to the treatment they were assigned at the beginning of the trial, they may switch treatment, discontinue as people do in a real-world setting. Consequently, analyzing the datasets from these pragmatic trials require properly accounting for patients based on whether they have actually received the treatment or not; and hence analysis strategies need to be updated and developed accordingly. The simplistic analysis strategies of clinical trials are often inadequate in the presence of treatment non-adherence. Our project has developed and evaluated methods for promoting causal inference in analyzing pragmatic trial data. Patients and researchers will benefit from these research outcomes, as we have outlined which methods are appropriate to analyze a variety of clinical settings where non-adherence or partial adherence exists in pragmatic trials. Appropriately analyzing the pragmatic trials will inform healthcare professionals, patients, and other stakeholders about the implication of taking that treatment from an evidence-based approach; and the conclusions from these pragmatic trials are more suitable and relevant for health care decision-makers and patients. Below is a technical overview prepared for the methods cluster at the beginning of the project, back in 2018: Three trainees helped in conducting research, manuscript writing, presenting research in national and international conferences: Md Belal Hossain (SPPH UBC) Lucy Mosquera (Statistics UBC) Eric Sanders (Statistics UBC) and a patient partner was recruited for reviewing lay summaries and providing feedback. Objectives In this project, we have address some of the methodological issues underlying the suitability of some of the methods already proposed in the literature to tackle generalizability of findings associated with non-adherence to medication as outlines in the protocol, and how to enhance those methods for the settings that are more reflective of real-world settings. Objective 1. To assess the suitability of g-methods in addressing non-adherence under various realistic pragmatic trial settings when some of the post-randomization predictor values are missing. Objective 2. To estimate the patient-oriented effect considering various types of adherence in the estimation process. Objective 3. To compare various instrumental variable-based estimators to address non-adherence. Lay summaries While analyzing pragmatic trials datasets, not addressing incomplete treatment adherence can lead to biased treatment effect estimates. Sophisticated statistical methods are recently being developed, but often these methods are not well understood or accessible to the analysts. In this work, we have evaluated these methods and contrasted their performances with some of the commonly used methods under different realistic clinical settings. One particular challenging setting is when lab tests of the patients are done infrequently, and we have evaluated various missing data analysis techniques to address such challenges. There is some analytical guidance on how to estimate treatment effects when some patients are fully adherent, and some patients are not adherent at all (2 categories of adherence). However, in the real world, most patients are partially adherence. That means most patients start to take the treatment and then may decide to discontinue it for various reasons. Our research has extended the existing analytic approach to accommodate patients who may partially adhere to the treatment (e.g., considering a third category of adherence). For dealing with medication non-adherence, a few methods are proposed in the econometric literature (e.g., popularly known as instrumental variable analysis). However, it is currently unknown how good those econometric methods are compared to the statistical methods (as mentioned above) if we apply them in the same context, focusing on pragmatic trials. In our project, we explored the characteristics of both of these methods and determined how useful these methods are in various clinical scenarios.

The best research makes sure that the people in both groups are very similar (e.g. same age and have had a similar seriousness of the disease for an equal length of time) and that patients dont get to choose or know whether they got the treatment or not (known as a placebo), until after the study is finished. Unfortunately, this type of research often does not include patients who are the most sick, of older age, or are from a different ethnic group. Also, sometimes there are patients who are unable to continue with the treatment and either take less of the drug or need to drop-out of the study, making it difficult to capture/measure their data. Therefore, it is difficult to accurately analyze the results of the study and be sure if the treatment would work as well on everyone who has the disease. This research project will use a new way to statistically analyze the results of a study to help patients and their doctors know whether a treatment is likely to work for them. What is treatment effectiveness? Let us consider that a drug company is proposing a new drug for curing patients suffering from a particular disease. To decide whether this new drug is actually effective in curing that disease or not, clinical trials are considered a gold standard. These clinical trials are designed carefully to make sure we can find out whether that drug is useful or not under a controlled condition. By control condition, I mean making sure that the trial participants are similar to each other in terms of age, sex and various other patient characteristics  controlling the conditions within our power. Ensuring such a control condition will enable statisticians to meaningfully compare the two groups: the group who took the drug (treated group), versus the group that was not given the drug (control group). If people from these two groups are mostly similar, but after the clinical trial end date, if we see there is a difference in cure /survival rate in these two groups, then we can attribute such difference as an effect due to the drug only. We call this difference a treatment effect. How can careful design of a standard clinical trial help us obtain a good understanding of how good a drug is? In these clinical trials, patients are assigned to different treatment groups at random (e.g., via coin toss). This randomization is a powerful tool that enables us to be free from bias. As the process of treatment assignment involves randomization, there is no reason for us to selectively assign older or sicker patients to the treated group, or selectively assign younger or healthier patients to the control group, thus creating bias. Statistically, it can be shown that when we have enough sample size, selecting patients by the process of randomization will eradicate most sources of bias. However, if we are not careful in patient selection, it is possible that the two groups could be somewhat different, particularly in small sample sizes. For example, consider a scenario where all the people from the treated group are much older than those in the control group. In that case, if we see that the cure /survival rate in these two groups are different, it is not clear how much of this difference is due to the drug, how much of it is due to age. Why do we need to be very careful about which patients are selected in a standard clinical trial? As running clinical trials are extremely expensive, and sometimes risky for frail patients (e.g., severely ill or patients with much older age), patients who are entered into the trial are highly selective, and the eligibility criteria for entering in the clinical trial is very restrictive (e.g., not at high risk, not suffering from any other related diseases, or not taking any medication that interacts with the drug under consideration). Such well-controlled clinical trials will be able to show whether there was any effect of that drug in ideal conditions. That means, the design of clinical trials are purposefully perfected for finding out how well the treatment works. Where do the regular clinical trials fail? Unfortunately, such a purist approach has consequences. Let us consider the example of multiple sclerosis (MS). Many of the drugs that are popularly used to treat MS were approved based on evidence from clinical trials that excluded patients over the age of 50. However, only considering British Columbia alone, about one-third of the older population (over 50 years of age) are prescribed these exact drugs in clinical practice today. Even though we do not know precisely whether these drugs are effective for people over 50 years of age, doctors continue to prescribe these patients these expensive drugs without much evidence to rely on. What is a clinical trial protocol? Trial protocols are documents, created by researcher (who conducts the clinical trials), that outlines how the trial will be conducted. These documents carefully describe clinical trial objectives (e.g., which two treatments will be compared), trial design and organization (e.g., how long the studies will continue, how long the patients should continue with the treatment or placebo, under what condition or side-effect they should interrupt the treatment), statistical considerations (e.g., how many patients should be recruited, which statistical techniques will be used). The trialists then try to follow the protocol document during the trial implementation as close as possible. What is a real-world pragmatic clinical trial? Is it more relevant from a patient perspective? Pragmatic trials include a broader range of subjects compared to a regular clinical trial. . These are the subjects who already receive the treatment in everyday clinical practice in a real-world usual care scenario. Therefore, this population, selected for a pragmatic trial, is much more representative of the real-world than the subjects selected for a regular clinical trial. Consequently, the conclusions from these pragmatic trials are more suitable and relevant for health care decision-makers and a greater number of patients. Challenges with Pragmatic trials in estimating treatment effect: statistical analysis of these data is not so simple anymore. Similar to regular clinical trials, subjects are randomized to different treatment groups at the beginning of the trial (known as the baseline period). Unfortunately, pragmatic trials offer different sets of challenges. As in the usual care scenario (under pragmatic trials), patients can deviate from the protocol, e.g., they may not be adherent to the treatment they were assigned at the beginning of the trial, they may switch treatment, or discontinue as people do in a real-world setting. However, to make the analysis of the data simple, treatment effects are often calculated based on intent-to-treat methods. That is, the intent-to-treat analysis is done based on which treatment groups (treated or control) patients were assigned to at the beginning of the trial. The analysis does not take into account whether patients actually receive the treatment or not. What is the effect of the treatment on the patients who actually took the drug? One can imagine that, at the end of a trial, the effect of a precisely same treatment will not be identical for the person who took treatment during the entire period of the clinical trial (e.g., 2 years), compared to the person who took treatment only half that time (e.g., 1 year). Statistically, it has been shown that the intent-to-treat estimate is influenced by the degree of adherence to the treatment. The estimate of the treatment effect will differ if all patients adhered to the treatment protocol/instruction versus if half of the patients stopped taking the treatment half-way through. This simple method provides an average estimate lumping together the people who may or may not have taken the treatment thoroughly. Such averaged-out results are unlikely to be useful for any patient in deciding whether or not to take the medication. These results will not accurately reflect the true benefit of the treatment for a given patient who would completely take the treatment as instructed. Patients and their healthcare professionals would be likely more interested in results that are more clinically relevant to them. They would like to know, if a patient takes a given treatment, what is his/her chance of getting cured. A patient is unlikely to be interested in knowing the effect of that treatment in someone who has different characteristics (age, sex etc.) than him/her. Why analysis strategies used for standard clinical trials fail analyzing pragmatic trial data? It is clear from the discussion above that, in analyzing the treatment effect, we need to consider this non-adherence to the treatment. Based on this observation, a few other estimation methods were proposed (known as per-protocol and as-treated methods). However, the problem with these methods is that, it is often the case that the randomization principle will be violated when implementing these methods, which is the basis for many clinical trials. As a result of using these simplistic approaches, the results obtained from these analyses are often biased and misleading. On one side, intent-to-treat methods are simple but give potentially wrong results for a patient about the effect of the treatment. Per-protocol methods take into account some aspects of non-adherence, but the reason for treatment discontinuation is not taken into account in the analysis. Hence, the results from this method are also misleading. If a person had to stop taking the treatment due to a side-effect or due to the patients perceived impact of the treatment, proper statistical techniques should be used to address such patterns accordingly. Causal inference methods can address some of the above challenges Fortunately, there has been a large number of methodological and statistical research done for the scenario where randomization may not be present. These research try to carefully identify cause of a disease outcome. For example, if a person is getting cured from a disease, whether that is a result of taking the drug or some other reason. Such research is often known as careful analysis of observational data (without randomization) using epidemiologic considerations. Epidemiology is the study of distribution and determinants of disease in populations, epidemiologic considerations mean understanding possible bias sources so that we can remove that bias, and the resulting conclusions from the analysis are meaningful and interpretable (e.g., free from bias, and hence our inference is based on cause and effect). For our context, accounting for bias sources could mean, while trying to decide whether a drug works or not, we think hard about what are the sources of bias e.g., some patients who are supposed to take a prescribed drug, did they actually took the drug. If they did not take the prescribed drugs, then the results would be biased, and we need to apply appropriate methodological and statistical techniques to remove such source of bias. Many of the methods proposed in this area of research (causal inference methods) have the potential to be applied to the area of pragmatic clinical trials, e.g., particularly, to deal with non-adherence. In the following part we will discuss them in further details. "],["addressing-the-medication-non-adherence-problem-using-data-that-are-collected-over-time.html", "Chapter 3 Addressing the medication non-adherence problem using data that are collected over time Background about data collection Why researchers should budget accordingly to collect patient information regularly Statistical development of longitudinal data analysis methods, and gaps in research Our research filling the gap A demonstration of an application of our method", " Chapter 3 Addressing the medication non-adherence problem using data that are collected over time Not addressing incomplete treatment adherence in the analysis can lead to biased treatment effect estimates (e.g., how helpful the treatments are) while analyzing pragmatic trials datasets. Sophisticated statistical methods are recently being developed for estimating treatment effect in the presence of treatment non-adherence, but often these methods are not well understood or accessible to the analysts. In this work, we have evaluated these methods and contrasted their performances with some of the commonly used methods under different realistic clinical settings. Background about data collection Clinical trials collect information about patients (e.g., age, sex, co-morbidity) before the randomization of patients in the trial. These patient characteristics are often utilized to estimate treatment effect, e.g., to obtain a more patient characteristic-specific treatment effect (i.e., treatment effect on female-only patients), reduce bias in the analysis, or reduce some uncertainty or doubt about the treatment effect. During regular routine health care (clinic or doctors office) or hospitals, however, administrative databases regularly collect or continuously monitor additional information about patients health over time (e.g., other disease status, visits to doctors, emergency visits, hospital admission records, medication, and diagnosis reports). These are the continuous monitoring data that are recorded. In a regular clinical trial, these are called post-randomization observations (measured after randomization), and often discarded from the analysis. This practice is particularly popular, because handling these large amounts of a continuous flow of data is hard, and analyzing them used to be even more challenging than it is now. Why researchers should budget accordingly to collect patient information regularly Regular clinical trials usually last for short-term (3-5 years), whereas pragmatic trials can go on for many more years (10-15 years), and the condition of the patients may change over the course of time. Incorporating more current information into the ongoing data analysis should help us adequately understand who is benefiting from the use of the drugs in the long term, and under which circumstances these benefits can be maximized. Also, for chronic conditions, such as diabetes or multiple sclerosis, where patients are required to take treatments for many years, medication adherence (whether patients are taking prescription medication as prescribed) should be measured continuously. Taking this longitudinal information (i.e., information that is collected over time) in the analysis, we can better understand the health implication of taking versus not taking the treatment regularly. Results from analysis done with such longitudinal information will be more accurate and relevant for the patient and their treatment decision-makers. Statistical development of longitudinal data analysis methods, and gaps in research Statisticians, in recent years, have shown that utilizing this post-randomization information can significantly benefit understanding the reasons why some patients may be continuing, discontinuing, or switching the treatment. Statisticians have also developed methods that can use this longitudinal information to predict the tendency of a patient to be adherent to medication These methods are known as inverse probability of adherence per-protocol methods, where researchers first estimate the probability of medication adherence in a given period, and then use this probabilistic information to estimate the effect of the treatment if received correctly. These methods for analyzing data generally separate the patients into two groups: (1) whether the patient sufficiently adhered to the prescribed treatment or (2) not in a given period (say, monthly) during the follow-up. To determine whether a patient is sufficiently medication adherent, many researchers use an 80% cut-point, although this cut-point may vary depending on the disease area. Therefore, if a patient took 85% of the medication within a month, we would label that patient as being adherent for that month. On the other hand, if a patient took 70% of the medication within a month, we would label that patient as being non-adherent for that month. Based on these advanced statistical methods and updated (e.g., monthly) information about adherence pattern, analysts can refine the analysis to obtain a valid estimate after considering medication adherence patterns. However, although the statistical theories were developed, some of these methods relying on updated information have not been well-tested within the context of pragmatic trials. Our research filling the gap In our project, our aim is to investigate the usefulness of these advanced statistical methods in addressing our specific problem of non-adherence under a variety of realistic pragmatic trial settings, and how to measure reasonable effects of the treatment received in a pragmatic trial. To assess these methods, we first mimicked or simulated data based on realistic pragmatic trial scenarios. Some examples include, We considered different disease scenarios: We considered a scenario when treatment adherence is affected by other conditions, e.g., whether a patient has access to healthcare or pharmacy. We considered a scenario when treatment adherence is affected by new health events during the follow-up: e.g., other medications that the same patient has to take due to a newly diagnosed co-morbidity. We considered a scenario when treatment adherence is not affected by other conditions during the follow-up: e.g., say patient discontinues taking the medication because of a perceived effect of the treatment on health - drug is not working. What is the impact when access to healthcare or pharmacy is important for our analysis, but we have not measured that information at the data collection stage? We investigated the above realistic scenarios, and analyzed the mimicked data. We concluded that the statistical methods described earlier, which can utilize post-randomization information, could provide us better treatment effect estimates in most scenarios of a pragmatic trial. That means, compared to conventional methods used in clinical trials, these advanced statistical methods can provide us more reasonable estimates (i.e., with reduced biasing effect). We also showed that even if the researchers fail to measure some of the necessary information during the data collection stage, these advanced statistical methods are still able to better approximate the effect estimate, compared to conventional methods used in clinical trials. We also considered a situation when the treated group (who are prescribed a new treatment) adheres to the treatment differently than the control group (who are prescribed an existing drug, or standard of care; also called treatment control arm). For example, let us consider a study on diabetic patients where we are interested in the impact of exercise daily. A diabetic patient who is assigned to the control arm, is supposed to take metformin drug 3 times a day but does not need to do any exercise during the day, and this person adheres to the prescribed dosage of the treatment. But another diabetic patient who is assigned to the treatment arm, should take metformin drug 3 times a day with 1 hour of exercise, but the patient actually takes only 1 metformin per day, and continues with 1 hour of exercise. Would this difference in medication-taking pattern impact the analysis? Generally speaking, if participants in the study mostly follow the prescription with occasionally missing a few days here and there, statistical methods, that can utilize post-randomization information, usually perform a pretty good job in obtaining the treatment effect estimate. First, let us talk about what happens if both treatment arms have similar non-adherence patterns. Depending on the degree of non-adherence, the estimates from these methods may suffer. Say, for example, if the rate of non-adherence is moderate, say, 30% of the time patients deviate from the prescription, only a negligible bias is introduced. If the rate of non-adherence is very high, say over 60% of the time, then a noticeable amount of bias is induced. If we consider the situation when there exists a difference in medication-taking pattern in both arms, say if the rate of non-adherence for the treatment group is very high, say over 60% of the time, but the control group patients mostly adheres to the treatment (say, only 30% of the time they do not adhere), then this would be a better situation than the case when both groups are being equally non-adherent to the treatment. When patients visit the hospital or doctors office frequently or rarely? For example, what happens if a patient is required to visit regularly every year, versus every 6 months. If the visit frequency changes, can we still estimate the treatment effect? When the patients interact with the health systems (e.g., visit to the clinic) less often, we do not get to measure the necessary information more often, and hence we have access to less frequent post-randomization information during the follow-up. When the visit frequencies are very low, then even the estimates obtained from the advanced statistical methods will not be reliable. We need more frequent information collection in order to get a better understanding of the treatment effect estimate. If the patients visit the clinic less often and the adherence patterns in both arms are different, then the results can be even less reliable. Particularly, we need a good flow of information about whether patients took the medication regularly. Otherwise, patients may fail to recall whether they followed the prescription closely if they visit ti the clinic less often. We should encourage researchers to take the initiative to collect patient information more often. We also considered additional scenarios. For example, what happens if we only include a small number of patients in a pragmatic trial? What happens if the disease outcome is rare? These investigations will help future researchers to determine how good these statistical methods are in a given trial with specific sample size. A demonstration of an application of our method We also included a case study from the Lipid Research Clinics Coronary Primary Prevention Trial to show an application of our methods in a real dataset. This trial had a sample size of 3, 550, with nearly 80% of the subjects deviated from the randomization treatment group by the end of the follow-up. The case study assessed whether a long-term reduction of serum cholesterol in hypercholesterolemic (elevated cholesterol) men, initially free of coronary heart disease, would lead to a lesser incidence of coronary heart disease. In the original study, only a conventional method was used, which could not take into account proper consideration of adherence patterns, and the results were biased. In the current work, we have analyzed the data in a suitableway to address the non-adherence problem. This case study demonstrates real-world applications of the estimators under consideration to account for non-adherence over time. "],["addressing-the-partial-non-adherence-problem.html", "Chapter 4 Addressing the partial non-adherence problem Background Existing methods to deal with adherence Our methods development Why our research is valuable in practical settings", " Chapter 4 Addressing the partial non-adherence problem Background Randomized clinical trials are considered a gold standard for evaluating how effective a particular new drug is. In these trials, highly experienced investigators work with highly selected participants. Randomized clinical trials usually follow strict protocols or rules to measure medication adherence. However, one common criticism is that these results from randomized clinical trials may not be readily translated to the general patients who are treated in a real-world clinical practice setting. To attempt to generalize the trial results to a larger and more realistic population, pragmatic trials (i.e., trials designed to evaluate treatment effects in real-world settings) are conducted that mimic real-world clinical practice settings. In a regular clinical setting, medical staff could be less experienced than highly trained clinical trial staff, and may not be as precise in administering treatment. On a broader population, patients outside of the strict inclusion criteria (e.g., could be older age patients who are often not included in a randomized clinical trial) may experience different adverse effects, and patients may not adequately follow the prescribed guidelines for a medication or its dose. Pragmatic trials, therefore, aim to incorporate these more realistic scenarios regarding patient and caregiver behaviours better than a standard randomized clinical trial. In that sense, pragmatic clinical trials are a step towards patient-oriented research that can be useful in providing real-world evidence, filling the gaps between clinical trials and clinical practices, and can answer questions likely to be the most relevant for many more patients than a clinical trial. Existing methods to deal with adherence There is some literature and guidance on how to estimate treatment effect when some patients are fully adherent, and some patients are not adherent at all. However, in the real world, most patients are somewhere in the middle, e.g., partially adherent. That means, most of the patients start to take the treatment and then decided to discontinue it for various reasons (e.g., patients who might skip a dose now and again). As per our review of the literature, the most conventional methods that address adherence (e.g., intent-to-treat, principal stratification methods) utilized to handle the problem of partial adherence is to simply re-label partially adherent participants as either fully adherent (i.e., fully compliant) or fully non-adherent (i.e., fully non-compliant). These conventional methods for analyzing clinical trial data generally separate the patients between two groups: whether the patient is fully adherent to the prescribed treatment or not. Therefore, if a patient took 100% of the medication during the follow-up, we would label that patient as being adherent. On the other hand, if a patient took no medication during the follow-up, we would label that patient as being non-adherent. If a patient took 70% of the medication during the follow-up, this is a patient who is partially compliant. Most patients fall in this category in reality. For these patients, analysts need to make decisions regarding whether to assign them to fully adherent versus fully non-adherent group, to be able to use the conventional methods. Recent research suggests that such artificial adherence group assignment leads to biased results and incorrect conclusions. To mitigate the problem associated with strict dichotomization methods, other researchers proposed methods that required the collection of rigorous and detailed post-randomization information frequently collected/recorded during the follow-up visits (e.g., collection of adherence data every month). While those methods are useful, collecting such a regular flow of information during a long follow-up may not be practical or cost-effective in a real-world pragmatic trial setting, particularly for chronic diseases. Our methods development For those scenarios, in this research, we have extended an existing approach (i.e., the principal stratification approach which is a statistical technique used in causal inference that can accommodate adjusting results for post-treatment covariates) to accommodate 3 medication adherence categories instead of 2. In our method, instead of assigning patients to fully adherent and fully non-adherent groups, we can also consider fully non-adherent, partially adherent, and fully adherent groups according to their medication adherence behavior. Using mimicked data analysis, we showed that the newly developed method can mitigate this longstanding partial adherence issue far better than the conventional approaches regarding bias and uncertainty in estimates. Just like any other statistical methods, our developed method also relies on some statistical assumptions. We have assessed a range of simulation or mimicked data settings, and explored the impact of failing to incorporate appropriate statistical assumptions or conditions in the analysis. As an example, we used a real dataset from a trial, which was designed to estimate the impact of attending a series of workshops (i.e., attending workshops were study interventions) for smoking cessation (i.e., study outcome) among individuals with psychotic disorders. But some patients attended all workshops (8 in total), some did not attend enough of them (less than 5), and some attended a few of them (between 5 and 7). Although in the original trial, they had three tiers of treatment adherence (full, partial, none), the researchers used conventional methods to analyze the data. However, they could not incorporate the partial adherence category properly due to the use of a conventional method. In our work, we applied our developed method to address the same problem, but now we were able to handle three tiers of treatment adherence in the analysis properly. Why our research is valuable in practical settings As we have developed the statistical framework for our method, this same method can now be extended to more general settings where we have more than 3 categories of medication adherence; one such example could be the analysis of the following categories, if such measurements are possible: no adherence (say 0%), poor adherence (say, 1-34%), moderate adherence (say, 35-66%), high adherence (67-99%) and full adherence (100%). Our research also shows that future researchers should not artificially dichotomize adherence patterns using conventional methods, and encourages researchers to retain more adherence categories in the analysis to obtain better results using the methods that we developed. Analysis of pragmatic clinical trial data can be reflective of real-world clinical practice settings, and can be useful in providing real-word evidence, filling the gaps between clinical trials and clinical practices. However, flexibility in adhering to the protocol comes at a price. If trials are pragmatic in a way that is less strict than an RCT in regulating treatment adherence, analysis strategy must take that into account. In our work, we have shown that our proposed method based on principal stratification can mitigate this partial adherence issue far better than the conventional approaches. Hopefully, utilizing the developed method, we will be able to reduce the amount of bias in the analysis of future pragmatic clinical trial research.

In econometrics, instrumental variable methods are widely used to estimate the treatment effect after controlling for unmeasured confounding. For dealing with medication non-adherence, a few analyses are proposed in the econometric literature based on these instrumental variable methods. These analysis strategies have a very different methodological origin from the epidemiological methods that are used to deal with non-adherence in the clinical or epidemiological data analysis. In the epidemiological analyses, the per-protocol effect is the effect that would have been estimated if all patients had adhered to their assigned treatment strategies during the entire follow-up, and new methods have beed developed in the epidemiological studies to estimate such effects (one such method is the inverse probability of adherence adjustment method). Although both of these methods mentioned above have the potential to address the treatment non-adherence issue, it is currently unknown how good those econometric methods are compared to the epidemiological methods if we apply them in the same context or same clinical situations (e.g., same study), with a particular focus on pragmatic trials. In the current project, we explored the statistical characteristics of both of these methods and determined how useful these methods are in various scenarios. Advantage of econometric methods In regular care (e.g. outside of clinic) or hospitals, collecting information about patients health over time is often difficult. Particularly for chronic diseases, following patients for a long time may be difficult and costly, if a reliable electronic health care record system is not available (e.g., many countries do not have such a database). Moreover, collecting information over time requires measuring all post-randomization factors (measured after randomization) that impact treatment non-adherence. Not measuring those relevant observations often results in biased treatment effect estimates. Results from the analysis without relevant information over time may misleadingly indicate a less beneficial treatment as an efficacious treatment or a beneficial treatment as not beneficial. In such scenarios, econometric methods can be useful as it relies on collecting information about patients health at only a single time point (e.g., single visit after trial randomization). The use of these econometric methods offers to reduce the burden of collecting data over time. Different methods suitable in different clinical settings However, in order to properly analyze the data using these ecomnometric methods, there are other statistical assumptions that should be met (i.e., in certain clinical settings, these methods may not perform optimally). We can use epidemiological methods in the same setting, but they require different statistical assumptions (i.e., these methods may not perform optimally in some other clinical settings). However, it is possible that under different clinical settings, these econometric and epidemiological methods may not perform similarly. One example could be a genetic factor influencing a lifestyle behavior (e.g., feeling hungry and eating frequently) and health outcome, but that lifestyle behaviour then impacts the adherence pattern for a patient (e.g., medication-taking requires some fasting). There may be no direct way to measure or identify that genetic factor. Ideally, econometric methods perform well in these settings in terms of bias even when the genetic factor remains unmeasured, but epidemiologic methods may not perform well in this same setting. We could not find a comprehensive investigation of the comparison of these stated methods to address non-adherence in the literature, and we need to identify which methods are appropriate to use under which practical clinical setting. Our investigation In our project, we, therefore, aimed to identify which method is appropriate in which practical clinical setting. We considered the following scenarios: We considered a scenario when treatment adherence is influenced by patients characteristics, e.g., older age, gender, socioeconomic status, etc. We considered scenarios when information on most characteristics is measured. This is the ideal scenario where econometric methods should provide optimal results. In terms of bias, both methods performed well, but the uncertainty associated with econometric methods was high. All methods have different statistical modelling assumptions. We considered scenarios with minor to substantial violations of those assumptions and checked which method can provide us better treatment effect estimates after addressing the non-adherence issue. We have identified scenarios where econometric methods performed well, and separately identified scenarios when epidemiological methods performed well. We have also shown ed what happens when assumptions necessary for both methods are violated (e.g., a worst-case scenario for both methods), compared the findings. In many pragmatic trials, not every participant in the treated group (who have been prescribed a new treatment) takes the assigned treatment. On the other hand, the new treatment is usually beyond the reach of the participants in the control group (who are prescribed a placebo). We considered a number of scenarios, where treatment non-adherence rates are different (between 10-90%) in the treated group. The econometric methods generally did not perform well when the adherence patterns for the treated group and the control group were different. In the econometric literature, there are some new methods that claim to reduce uncertainty. However, in our analysis, we found that even those new methods may report increased uncertainty when the adherence rate is moderate. How our research is helpful for future researchers We explored the above realistic scenarios by analyzing a series of the mimicked (i.e., simulated) data. Results from these analyses helped us understand how each method performed in each clinical setting. Understanding these comparisons will guide future researchers in determining suitable analysis strategies. Choosing appropriate analysing strategy will help obtain results free from bias, and a clear picture of the tratments benefit will help patients and caregivers to make a decision about their treatment. Our analysis showed no single method that can obtain better results in all clinical settings. It is essential to have deep knowledge in the disease area to be able to understand the complexity of the setting and which statistical assumptions are plausible. Therefore, statisticians should always work with researchers and patient partners knowledgeable about the disease area to get a better sense of the complexity of the problem, and then analyze the data appropriately with that understanding. Application of the methods in a real data We also analyzed clinical trial data estimating the effect of vitamin A supplementation on childhood mortality after addressing non-adherence. In this real dataset, vitamin A supplements were unavailable to children in the control group. On the other hand, not every child took the assigned vitamin A supplementation in the treated group, and the non-adherence rate was 20% among those from the treated group (similar to our mimicked data experience). This case study demonstrates real-world applications of both (the econometric and epidemiological) methods under consideration to account for non-adherence in the same setting. Hopefully our work will help the analysts understand the utilities and limitations of both econometric and epidemiological methods, and when it is most appropriate to used one of these methods.
