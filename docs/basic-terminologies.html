<h1><span class="header-section-number">Chapter 2</span> Basic terminologies</h1>
<p>Medical research to find out whether a treatment works for a disease or condition typically depends on comparing the results of two groups of people – those who get the treatment versus those who do not. The best research makes sure that the people in both groups are very similar (e.g. same age and have had a similar seriousness of the disease for an equal length of time) and that they don’t get to choose or know whether they got the treatment or placebo until after the study is finished. Unfortunately, this type of research often does not include patients who are the most sick, of older age, or are from a different ethnic group. Also, sometimes there are patients who are unable to continue with the treatment and either take less of the drug or need to drop-out of the study. Therefore, it is difficult to accurately analyze the results of the study and be sure if the treatment would work as well on everyone who has the disease. This research project will use a new way to statistically analyze the results of a study to help patients and their doctors know whether a treatment is likely to work for them.</p>
<div id="what-is-treatment-effectiveness" class="section level2" number="2.1">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.1</span> What is ‘treatment effectiveness?’</h2>
<p>Let us consider that a drug company is proposing a new drug for curing patients suffering from a particular disease. To decide whether this new drug is actually effective in curing that disease or not, clinical trials are considered a gold standard. These clinical trials are designed carefully to make sure we can find out whether that drug is useful or not under a controlled condition. By control condition, I mean making sure that the trial participants are similar to each other in terms of age, sex and various other patient characteristics. Ensuring to have such a control condition will enable statisticians to meaningfully compare the two groups:</p>
<ul>
<li>the group who took the drug (treated group), versus</li>
<li>the group that was not given the drug (control group).</li>
</ul>
<p>If people from these two groups are mostly similar, but after the clinical trial end date, if we see there is a difference in cure /survival rate in these two groups, then we can attribute such difference as an ‘effect’ due to the drug only. We call this difference a treatment effect.</p>
</div>
<div id="how-can-careful-design-of-a-standard-clinical-trial-help-us-obtain-a-good-understanding-of-how-good-a-drug-is" class="section level2" number="2.2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.2</span> How can careful design of a standard clinical trial help us obtain a good understanding of how good a drug is?</h2>
<p>In these clinical trials, patients are assigned to different treatment groups at random (e.g., via coin toss). This randomization is a powerful tool that enables us to be free from bias. As the process of treatment assignment involves randomization, there is no reason for us to selectively assign older or sicker patients to the treated group, or selectively assign younger or healthier patients to the control group. Statistically, it can be shown that when we have enough sample size, selecting patients by the process of randomization will eradicate most sources of bias.</p>
<p>However, if we are not careful in patient selection, it is possible that the two groups could be somewhat different, particularly in small sample sizes. For example, consider a scenario where all the people from the treated group are much older than those in the control group. In that case, if we see that the cure /survival rate in these two groups are different, it is not clear how much of this difference is due to the drug, how much of it is due to age.</p>
</div>
<div id="why-do-we-need-to-be-very-careful-about-which-patients-are-selected-in-a-standard-clinical-trial" class="section level2" number="2.3">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.3</span> Why do we need to be very careful about which patients are selected in a standard clinical trial?</h2>
<p>As running clinical trials are extremely expensive, and sometimes risky for frail patients (e.g., severely ill or patients with much older age), patients who are entered into the trial are highly selective, and the eligibility criteria for entering in the clinical trial is very restrictive (e.g., not at high risk, not suffering from any other related diseases, or not taking any medication that interacts with the drug under consideration). Such well-controlled clinical trials will be able to show whether there was any effect of that drug in ideal condition. That means, the design of clinical trials are purposefully optimized for finding out the treatment efficacy.</p>
</div>
<div id="where-do-the-regular-clinical-trials-fail" class="section level2" number="2.4">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.4</span> Where do the regular clinical trials fail?</h2>
<p>Unfortunately, such a purist approach has consequences. Let us consider the example of multiple sclerosis (MS). Many of the drugs that are popularly used to treat MS were approved based on evidence from clinical trials that excluded patients over the age of 50. However, only considering British Columbia, about one-third of the older population (over 50 years of age) are prescribed these exact drugs in clinical practice. Even though we do not know precisely whether these drugs are effective for these people over 50 years of age, doctors continue to prescribe them these expensive drugs without much evidence in their hands.</p>
</div>
<div id="what-is-a-clinical-trial-protocol" class="section level2" number="2.5">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.5</span> What is a clinical trial protocol?</h2>
<p>Trial protocols are “documents,” created by trialists, that outlines how the trial will be conducted. These documents carefully describe clinical trial objectives (e.g., which two treatments will be compared), trial design and organization (e.g., how long the studies will continue, how long the patients should continue with the treatment or placebo, under what condition or side-effect they should interrupt the treatment), statistical considerations (e.g., how many patients should be recruited, which statistical techniques will be used). The trialists then try to follow the protocol document during the trial implementation as close as possible.</p>
</div>
<div id="what-is-a-real-world-pragmatic-clinical-trial-is-it-more-relevant-from-a-patient-perspective" class="section level2" number="2.6">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.6</span> What is a real-world pragmatic clinical trial? Is it more relevant from a patient perspective?</h2>
<p>‘Pragmatic trials’ include a broader range of subjects compared to a regular clinical trial. These are the subjects who receive the treatment in everyday clinical practice in a real-world usual care scenario. Therefore, this population, selected for a pragmatic trial, is much more representative than the subjects selected for a regular clinical trial. Consequently, the conclusions from these pragmatic trials are more suitable and relevant for health care decision-makers and patients.</p>
</div>
<div id="challenges-with-pragmatic-trials-in-estimating-treatment-effect-statistical-analysis-of-these-data-is-not-so-simple-anymore." class="section level2" number="2.7">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.7</span> Challenges with Pragmatic trials in estimating treatment effect: statistical analysis of these data is not so simple anymore.</h2>
<p>Similar to regular clinical trials, subjects are randomized to different treatment groups at the beginning of the trial (known as the baseline period). Unfortunately, pragmatic trials offer different sets of challenges. As in the usual care scenario (under pragmatic trials), patients can deviate from the protocol, e.g., they may not be adherent to the treatment they were assigned at the beginning of the trial, they may switch treatment, discontinue as people do in a real-world setting. However, to make the analysis of the data simple, treatment effects are often calculated based on ‘intent-to-treat’ (ITT) methods. That is, this simple analysis does not take into account of whether patients actually receive the treatment or not. The analysis is done based on which in treatment groups (treated or control) they were assigned to at the beginning of the trial.</p>
</div>
<div id="what-is-the-effect-of-the-treatment-on-the-patients-who-actually-took-the-drug" class="section level2" number="2.8">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.8</span> What is the effect of the treatment on the patients who ‘actually took the drug?’</h2>
<p>One can imagine that, at the end of a trial, the effect of a precisely same treatment will not be identical for the person who took treatment during the entire period of the clinical trial (e.g., 2 years), compared to the person who took treatment only half that time (e.g., 1 year). Statistically, it has been shown that the ITT estimate is influenced by the degree of adherence to the treatment. The estimate of the treatment effect will differ if all patients adhered to the treatment protocol/instruction versus half of the patients stopped taking the treatment half-way through. This simple method provides an average estimate lumping together the people who may or may not have taken the treatment thoroughly. Such averaged-out results are unlikely to be useful for any patient in deciding whether or not to take the medication. These results will not accurately reflect the true benefit of the treatment for a given patient who would completely take the treatment as instructed. Patients and their healthcare professionals would be likely more interested in results that are more clinically relevant to them. They would like to know, if a patient takes a given treatment, what is his/her chance of getting cured. A patient is unlikely to be interested in knowing the effect of that treatment in someone who has different characteristics (age, sex etc.) than him/her.</p>
</div>
<div id="why-analysis-strategies-used-for-standard-clinical-trials-fail-for-analyzing-pragmatic-trial-data" class="section level2" number="2.9">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.9</span> Why analysis strategies used for standard clinical trials fail for analyzing pragmatic trial data?</h2>
<p>It is clear from the discussion above that, in analyzing the treatment effect, we need to consider this non-adherence to the treatment. Based on this observation, a few other estimation methods were proposed (known as per-protocol and as-treated methods). However, the problem with these methods is that, it is often the case that the randomization principle will be violated for these methods, which is the basis for any clinical trials. As a result of using these simplistic approaches, the results are obtained from these analyses are often biased and misleading. On one side, intent-to-treat methods are simple but give potentially wrong results for a patient about the effect of the treatment. Per-protocol methods take into account some aspects of non-adherence, but the reason for treatment discontinuation is not taken into account in the analysis. Hence, the results from this method are also misleading. If a person had to stop taking the treatment due to a side-effect or due to the patient’s perceived impact of the treatment, proper statistical techniques should be used to address such patterns accordingly.</p>
</div>
<div id="causal-inference-methods-can-address-some-of-the-above-challenges" class="section level2" number="2.10">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.10</span> ‘Causal inference’ methods can address some of the above challenges</h2>
<p>Fortunately, there has been a large number of methodological and statistical research done for the scenario where randomization may not be present. Such research is often known as careful analysis of observational data using epidemiologic considerations or ‘causal inference.’ Many of the methods proposed in this area of research have the potential to be applied to the area of pragmatic clinical trials, e.g., particularly, to deal with non-adherence.</p>
