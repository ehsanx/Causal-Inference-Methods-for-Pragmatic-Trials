## Objectives {-}

In this project, we have address some of the methodological issues underlying the suitability of some of the methods already proposed in the literature to tackle generalizability of findings associated with non-adherence to medication as outlines in the protocol, and how to enhance those methods for the settings that are more reflective of real-world settings. 

- **Objective 1**. To assess the suitability of ‘g-methods’ in addressing non-adherence under various realistic pragmatic trial settings when some of the post-randomization predictor values are missing. 
- **Objective 2**. To estimate the ‘patient-oriented effect’ considering various types of adherence in the estimation process. 
- **Objective 3**. To compare various instrumental variable-based estimators to address non-adherence.
